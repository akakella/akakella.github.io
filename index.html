<article class="post-content">
<p>I'm currently a Master's student at the University of California, Berkeley, studying mechanical engineering. My
academic interests are primarily in control theory and mechatronics, with a focus on robotics and automotive applications. Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a BS in Mechanical Engineering (minor in EECS) in May 2015.

<p>
In between my schooling, I interned at General Motors (working on powertrain design for electric/hybrid vehicles)
and Western Digital (working on control system development for advanced hard disk drive processes). I've also had the opportunity to work on a number of other projects throughout my undergraduate career at Berkeley -
