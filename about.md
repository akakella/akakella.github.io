Hi, I'm Abishek. I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where I received my Master's and Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering. My interests are primarily in control theory, mechatronics, and robotics. 

This website contains a snapshot of somet of the personal and academic projects that I've worked on over the past few years. Feel free to contact me about anything here through one of the mediums below.
